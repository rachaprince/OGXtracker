	// The first thing I would imagine on this page is a short list of suggested TNs based on the candidates preferences. If the EP doesn't like any of these, the EP manager can also search our database from this page and add them manually.
	<br>
	<br>
	//Then the EP manager can manually update TNs to "working on matching"
	<br>
	<br>
	//Somewhere else on this site (Not the EP page) I would like to have a nicely formatted list of TNs that would automatically update in a google spreadsheet when we added them.
