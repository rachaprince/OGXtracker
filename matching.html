	//Here would be a list of TNs we are currently working on matching for the EP

	//Here might be unread emails. Gmail should be directly integrated into this window. To reply, the OGX member would type into a compose email box on this page. 
	<br>
	<br>
	//These might be other email threads attached to the EP. 
	<br>

	//Ideally, there would be an alert on the main EP page if the TNs needed attention. Then the EP manager could scroll down, click on the box for that EP and reply to the email. Hopefully.
