	// Here I imagine a nice fancy view of the application the EP submitted through Podio. 
	<br>
	<br>
	//I imagine I will spiff up the application as a part of my JD this semester
	<br>
	<br>
	//Hopefully, working with the Podio API, I can make it easy to get information like which countries the applicant want to go to, when they want to go, etc. Then this program can automatically suggest some TNs and the EP manager will not have to go through everything right off the bat.

	//Honestly I think this will be the hardest step.
